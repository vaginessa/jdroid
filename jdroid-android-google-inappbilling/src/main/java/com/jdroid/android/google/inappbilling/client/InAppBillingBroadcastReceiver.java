 * redeemed from inside the Play Store using a promotional code. If this
 * application isn't running at the time, then when it is started a call
 * to getPurchases() will be sufficient notification. However, if the
 * application is already running in the background when the item is acquired,
 * a message to this BroadcastReceiver will indicate that the an item
 * has been acquired.</p>
 *
 * Use this command to simulate the broadcast:
 * adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.vending.billing.PURCHASES_UPDATED
